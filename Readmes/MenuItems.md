# Menu Items

With Sheeeeeeeeet, you can create `Menu`s that can be used in various ways, e.g. in iOS 13 context menus, custom action sheets and native alert controllers.

Menus contains menu items of various types, which are divided into `items`, `buttons` and `titles`. You can also create custom item types by subclassing any of the built-in types.

Menu items are converted to different types dependinc on where they are used. For instance, custom action sheets will convert them to `ActionSheetItemCell`s, while native action sheets can convert them to actions.


## Menu Item Types

Items are used to present options. Sheeeeeeeeet has the following built-in types:

* `MenuItem` - A standard menu item with a title, optional subtitle, image etc.
* `SelectItem` - A menu item that can be marked as `isSelected` and styled accordingly.
* `SingleSelectItem` - A select item that deselects all other single-select items in the same group.
* `MultiSelectItem` - A select item that doesn't deselect other select items.
* `MultiSelectItemToggle` - An item that selects/deselects all multi-select items in the same group.
* `LinkItem` - A standard menu item that renders as a link.
* `SecondaryActionItem` - A menu item that also has a secondary action.
* `CollectionItem` - A generic item that can contain any type of items (e.g. collection view cells).
* `Custom Item` - A generic item that can use any item (e.g. custom views).

All items, including the buttons and items below, inherit `MenuItem`. Each item has a `tapBehavior`, which determines how it should behave when tapped.


## Buttons

Buttons are used to apply or discard an action sheet. Sheeeeeeeeet has the following built-in types:

* `MenuButton` - A standard button with no default behavior
* `OkButton` - A standard ok/apply button
* `CancelButton` - A standard cancel button
* `DestructiveButton` - A destructive ok/apply button

OK and destructive buttons have `MenuButton.ButtonType.ok` as value, while cancel buttons have `MenuButton.ButtonType.cancel`. You can also check a button's type e.g. `button is OkButton`.

Different presentations handle buttons differently. Custom action sheets automatically separates buttons into a separate group, while popovers just ignore cancel buttons.


## Titles

Titles are non-interactive text or spacing elements. Sheeeeeeeeet has the following built-in types:

* `MenuTitle` - A main menu item
* `SectionTitle` - Can be used to indicate that some items belong together
* `SectionMargin` - Can be used to add spacing before and after a section title

You can add title items anywhere, although some presentations may ignore them. Custom action sheets will also add a title item to the menu if it has a title, so don't use `MenuTitle` directly.


## Header Views

`ActionSheet` has a `headerView` property, which will be displayed as a floating header above the action sheet. You can use any view as a header view.

`ActionSheet` also has a `headerViewConfiguration` with which you can setup how the header view should behave in various scenarios e.g. in landscape, popovers etc.


## Custom Items

Besides the built-in `CustomItem`, which is pretty complicated to setup, you can also create custom items that inherits any of the built-in item types. You can read more about custom menu items [here][CustomItems].
